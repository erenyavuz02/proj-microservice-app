# Microservice Project

This is a demo project for me to grasp concepts of microservice architectures, Spring Boot applications, Docker containerization, Kafka message broker, and more.

## Project Structure

The following schema represents the microservice architecture of this project:

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building microservices
- **Docker**: Containerization of applications
- **Kafka**: Message broker for communication between microservices
- **MySQL**: Database for data persistence
- **Zookeeper**: Coordination service for Kafka
