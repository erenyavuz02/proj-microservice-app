    # Restart the service unless explicitly stopped
    restart: unless-stopped
    # Set the root password for MySQL
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
    # Use a volume to persist the database data
    volumes:
      - db:/var/lib/mysql
    # Expose the port 3306 for MySQL
    ports:
      - 3306:3306
    # Add the service to the 'microservices-net' network
